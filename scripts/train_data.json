      "description": "There was a post circulating where an anonymous member stated Jasper will be burned down 70% and informed us; this is incorrect. The total number burned down is approx 30%. \n\n \nThe priority for the 154 firefighters in Jasper is to put out any hot spots in the outskirts of Jasper and in the trees directly surrounding the town of Jasper and all structures. Cooler conditions are reducing fire behaviour as showers tapered off overnight. Winds are anticipated to reach up to 30 km/h and may increase fire activity.\n \nAssessments of infrastructure damages is ongoing. The damage within the townsite is estimated at around 30%. Out of a total of 1113 structures within the town, 358 have been destroyed. All critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant. We are grateful to our wildfire teams efforts to contain the fire and minimize the damage.\n \nThis wildfire is estimated to cover 36,000 hectares.\n \n\nUpdate for residents:\nResidents and businesses of the town of Jasper, we understand that this is an incredibly difficult and challenging time but our priorities remain addressing the active fire and assessing structural damage in the community. We are happy to report all critical infrastructure has been saved. We appreciate how hard it is to wait for confirmation about your homes.\n \nOur crews continue to fight the fire and we remain focused on making it safe for the people of Jasper to come home. The area remains closed for public safety, evacuation order is still in effect.",

I stayed home till today the air quality was fine.\nYes- I was given a doctors note. The doctor said my mini asthma attacks should clear up on its own.\nNow today went to work smoke came even though air quality said fine. 67 yellow. Well, I started coughing then the pain came back. I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at. I also cannot call in because without a doctors note.\nAt this point I can’t even make it from my bedroom to the living room without being exhausted. I also can’t afford to lose this job. My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days. This time they gave me 30 for 2 days. ",

I stayed home till today the air quality was fine.\nYes- I was given a doctors note. The doctor said my mini asthma attacks should clear up on its own.\nNow today went to work smoke came even though air quality said fine. 67 yellow. Well, I started coughing then the pain came back. I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at. I also cannot call in because without a doctors note.\nAt this point I can’t even make it from my bedroom to the living room without being exhausted. I also can’t afford to lose this job. My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days. This time they gave me 30 for 2 days. ",

      "description": "There was a post circulating where an anonymous member stated Jasper will be burned down 70% and informed us; this is incorrect. The total number burned down is approx 30%. \n\n \nThe priority for the 154 firefighters in Jasper is to put out any hot spots in the outskirts of Jasper and in the trees directly surrounding the town of Jasper and all structures. Cooler conditions are reducing fire behaviour as showers tapered off overnight. Winds are anticipated to reach up to 30 km/h and may increase fire activity.\n \nAssessments of infrastructure damages is ongoing. The damage within the townsite is estimated at around 30%. Out of a total of 1113 structures within the town, 358 have been destroyed. All critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant. We are grateful to our wildfire teams efforts to contain the fire and minimize the damage.\n \nThis wildfire is estimated to cover 36,000 hectares.\n \n\nUpdate for residents:\nResidents and businesses of the town of Jasper, we understand that this is an incredibly difficult and challenging time but our priorities remain addressing the active fire and assessing structural damage in the community. We are happy to report all critical infrastructure has been saved. We appreciate how hard it is to wait for confirmation about your homes.\n \nOur crews continue to fight the fire and we remain focused on making it safe for the people of Jasper to come home. The area remains closed for public safety, evacuation order is still in effect.",

      "description": "There was a post circulating where an anonymous member stated Jasper will be burned down 70% and informed us; this is incorrect. The total number burned down is approx 30%. \n\n \nThe priority for the 154 firefighters in Jasper is to put out any hot spots in the outskirts of Jasper and in the trees directly surrounding the town of Jasper and all structures. Cooler conditions are reducing fire behaviour as showers tapered off overnight. Winds are anticipated to reach up to 30 km/h and may increase fire activity.\n \nAssessments of infrastructure damages is ongoing. The damage within the townsite is estimated at around 30%. Out of a total of 1113 structures within the town, 358 have been destroyed. All critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant. We are grateful to our wildfire teams efforts to contain the fire and minimize the damage.\n \nThis wildfire is estimated to cover 36,000 hectares.\n \n\nUpdate for residents:\nResidents and businesses of the town of Jasper, we understand that this is an incredibly difficult and challenging time but our priorities remain addressing the active fire and assessing structural damage in the community. We are happy to report all critical infrastructure has been saved. We appreciate how hard it is to wait for confirmation about your homes.\n \nOur crews continue to fight the fire and we remain focused on making it safe for the people of Jasper to come home. The area remains closed for public safety, evacuation order is still in effect.",

      "description": "At just before 6 pm this evening, portions of the South Fire in Jasper National Park reached the outskirts of the Jasper townsite after being driven by strong winds gusts from the south and southeast. \n\nParks Canada, the Municipality of Jasper, as well as responders from Alberta and other provinces are continuing with efforts to protect the town.\n\nThe safety of the public and responders is our top priority. \n\nFirefighters remain in town and are combating spot fires and maintaining sprinkler lines. \n\n10-20 mm of rain is forecasted to arrive in the next 24 hours, beginning later tonight. If the area receives rain it will help to reduce fire activity. \n\nThis afternoon, suppression efforts by helicopter bucketing proved ineffective. Fireguards being completed by heavy equipment were not able to be completed before the heavy equipment needed to be pulled off the fireline for safety. Water bombers from Alberta were unable to assist due to dangerous flying conditions.\n\nAn ignition specialist also arrived, with the goal to complete landscape-level ignition in order to bring the fire to large holding features such as Highway 16 and Athabasca River. Unfortunately, unfavourable conditions prevented this.\n\nIf you have not yet evacuated town you must leave now. This is for your own safety and to allow these critical operations to protect the town of Jasper to continue unimpeded.\n\nOur hearts go out to all of the affected community members, their families and their friends, many of which include our local first responders. Further updates and more information will be provided as soon as conditions allow for it.",

I stayed home till today the air quality was fine.\nYes- I was given a doctors note. The doctor said my mini asthma attacks should clear up on its own.\nNow today went to work smoke came even though air quality said fine. 67 yellow. Well, I started coughing then the pain came back. I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at. I also cannot call in because without a doctors note.\nAt this point I can’t even make it from my bedroom to the living room without being exhausted. I also can’t afford to lose this job. My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days. This time they gave me 30 for 2 days. ",

      "description": "Hi all, I apologize if this is a common question, but I've struggled to find a clear answer online. I'm going to be driving along the west coast next month and will be spending a lot of time outside in fairly remote areas. With all the wildfires sweeping the area, it's causing me concern. \n\nObviously, I plan to stay as far away from the fires as I can, but with how erratic wind patterns can be, it only takes an unexpected change in the weather to redirect enormous quantities of smoke directly at me, even dozens to hundreds of miles away. The Park Fire, for example, made the AQI in Lassen Volcanic National Park spike from 93 to 672 in the course of an afternoon today. In many circumstances, I might not have internet to warn me of these changing conditions, so I want to make sure I'm traveling with a powerful and reliable respirator in case I get caugth out in the open by one of these smoke clouds.\n\nI'd humbly ask for suggestions on the best p100 type masks/brands for this kind of task. I don't have an enormous budget, but I'm willing to spend up to about $100 (though I'd prefer closer to $50) for a real guarantee of safety. Ideally, this mask would be reusable and could handle conditions up to 500 AQI for at least a few hours, though if that's unrealistic, then however heavy air pollution I can protect myself against within my price range. It's also important that I be able to acquire this mask within a week, whether by shipping or pickup, because I won't be able to have anything delivered once I leave home. I live in a very rural area, so I don't have a lot of in-store options. Something online would be ideal.\n\nThank you for the help.",

Is there anyway to find out the reasons for these latest cancellations (to determine the likelihood of my flight)? \n\nThank you for any help or advice!

I stayed home till today the air quality was fine.\nYes- I was given a doctors note. The doctor said my mini asthma attacks should clear up on its own.\nNow today went to work smoke came even though air quality said fine. 67 yellow. Well, I started coughing then the pain came back. I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at. I also cannot call in because without a doctors note.\nAt this point I can’t even make it from my bedroom to the living room without being exhausted. I also can’t afford to lose this job. My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days. This time they gave me 30 for 2 days. ",

      "description": "Hi all, I apologize if this is a common question, but I've struggled to find a clear answer online. I'm going to be driving along the west coast next month and will be spending a lot of time outside in fairly remote areas. With all the wildfires sweeping the area, it's causing me concern. \n\nObviously, I plan to stay as far away from the fires as I can, but with how erratic wind patterns can be, it only takes an unexpected change in the weather to redirect enormous quantities of smoke directly at me, even dozens to hundreds of miles away. The Park Fire, for example, made the AQI in Lassen Volcanic National Park spike from 93 to 672 in the course of an afternoon today. In many circumstances, I might not have internet to warn me of these changing conditions, so I want to make sure I'm traveling with a powerful and reliable respirator in case I get caugth out in the open by one of these smoke clouds.\n\nI'd humbly ask for suggestions on the best p100 type masks/brands for this kind of task. I don't have an enormous budget, but I'm willing to spend up to about $100 (though I'd prefer closer to $50) for a real guarantee of safety. Ideally, this mask would be reusable and could handle conditions up to 500 AQI for at least a few hours, though if that's unrealistic, then however heavy air pollution I can protect myself against within my price range. It's also important that I be able to acquire this mask within a week, whether by shipping or pickup, because I won't be able to have anything delivered once I leave home. I live in a very rural area, so I don't have a lot of in-store options. Something online would be ideal.\n\nThank you for the help.",

Summer always brings risk of wildfire to all mountain regions but if you are new to the area please keep in mind the Canadian mountain regions are HUGE! \n\nBanff is approximately a 3+ hour drive to Jasper and 300km away, it is not impacted the same way as Jasper is. Impact is likely obscured views and bad smelling air from the smoke.\n\nIf your dream is to see the icefields parkway you might be in trouble as portions are closed but the immediate Banff and Lake Louisr areas are likely fine.",

My uncle is a hiker, but with the air quality I am worried that might be a bad idea. My cousin also has some health conditions so he should avoid the bad air as much as possible.\n\nThat being said, I would really appreciate for any recommendations for things to do in Banff and in the surrounding area. Ideally indoors stuff or maybe a location for hiking where air is okay and fire risk is minimal. They have a rental car.\n\nThank you very much. I hope everyone is doing well in these tough times.",

Based on the amount of destruction, it seems more and more likely that the area may be in recovery mode for some time to come. We’re driving up from Minnesota for a friend’s wedding in Banff on the 18th of August and then are camping for a few nights in Yoho. Originally we had planned to head up to Jasper to stay at Whistler after that but I’m searching for alternative plans for the Jasper portion now. We don’t want to be a burden on the area while they are rebuilding, and camping at Whistler will likely not be an option anyways.\n\nWe plan to day hike and drive whatever section of the Icefields Parkway that is open while staying in Banff/Yoho. I’d love recommendations for other national or provincial parks that are near-ish to a small town. We're mostly looking for a nice spot to camp and base out of while day hiking for 2-3 days. I'm just not familiar with the region to decide what direction to go in! I’ve heard the drive over to Revelstoke and the provincial parks south of there is pretty amazing and we were also thinking about Waterton. Or Mt. Robson park? We will be keeping an eye on fire activity no matter where we decide to go. Thank you friends, I know this is a small matter compared to what folks in Jasper have gone through.",

This week, 25 years later, I came back to retrace my steps with my wife and family. \n\nWe spent lovely days in Vancouver and then flew to Calgary. The drive to Banff and Lake Louise was beautiful and they were all thrilled to finally see Banff, Lake Louise and Moraine Lake. \n \nWhile they were super excited with the views, I immediately noticed the haze and I knew they weren’t being served the 4K  experience I had when I first visited. \n\nWe were due to drive to Jasper this morning and learned about the evacuation order. The campsite we had bookings is right in the middle of the red blob in the NASA wildfire radar website so we were lucky. We now drove back to Calgary. \n\nI’ve spent thousands of dollars to be here and many thousands more to redo our plans today. I don’t mind. I’m more concerned with the families and animals that had to be evacuated on short order, not knowing if they would come back to their homes or a pile of burnt wood. I think about the patients in hospitals and those already with health issues. I also think about the animals and plants in the national park, that can’t be evacuated at all. \n\nI just wanted to say that I will bring my family back here to support the recovery of this beautiful community. \n\nStay safe, stay strong and I truly hope that we can soon meet in different circumstances.

I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at.

My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days.

      "description": "Hi all, I apologize if this is a common question, but I've struggled to find a clear answer online. I'm going to be driving along the west coast next month and will be spending a lot of time outside in fairly remote areas. With all the wildfires sweeping the area, it's causing me concern. \n\nObviously, I plan to stay as far away from the fires as I can, but with how erratic wind patterns can be, it only takes an unexpected change in the weather to redirect enormous quantities of smoke directly at me, even dozens to hundreds of miles away. The Park Fire, for example, made the AQI in Lassen Volcanic National Park spike from 93 to 672 in the course of an afternoon today. In many circumstances, I might not have internet to warn me of these changing conditions, so I want to make sure I'm traveling with a powerful and reliable respirator in case I get caugth out in the open by one of these smoke clouds.\n\nI'd humbly ask for suggestions on the best p100 type masks/brands for this kind of task. I don't have an enormous budget, but I'm willing to spend up to about $100 (though I'd prefer closer to $50) for a real guarantee of safety. Ideally, this mask would be reusable and could handle conditions up to 500 AQI for at least a few hours, though if that's unrealistic, then however heavy air pollution I can protect myself against within my price range. It's also important that I be able to acquire this mask within a week, whether by shipping or pickup, because I won't be able to have anything delivered once I leave home. I live in a very rural area, so I don't have a lot of in-store options. Something online would be ideal.\n\nThank you for the help.",

PM10 particles are small enough to pass through the nose and throat and into the lungs, where they can deposit on the lung surface and cause tissue damage and inflammation. This can impact respiratory and cardiovascular health, and has been linked to a number of health problems, including:\nReduced lung function\nWorsening of asthma and other respiratory diseases\nIncreased hospitalization and emergency department visits\nFaster disease progression\nReduced life expectancy\nNonfatal heart attacks\nIrregular heartbeat\nIncreased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing ",

      "description": "So where I lived this week had gotten hit with wildfire smoke. It started Sunday. I was working and I had to go home because my lungs started to burn. I stayed home till today the air quality was fine.\nYes- I was given a doctors note. The doctor said my mini asthma attacks should clear up on its own.\nNow today went to work smoke came even though air quality said fine. 67 yellow. Well, I started coughing then the pain came back. I went to the walk-in clinic and they said I should have came in sooner. I have on set pneumonia.\nI was given meds and they wouldn’t give me a work for this weekend. Saying the meds should help.\nUmmm… my job is all physical labor. I also have to move fast if I don’t I will get yelled at. I also cannot call in because without a doctors note.\nAt this point I can’t even make it from my bedroom to the living room without being exhausted. I also can’t afford to lose this job. My boss will keep me till I am literally blue, and on the floor. I have no family or friends available to pick me up this weekend.\nIs there any advise? Also the steriods they gave me are a very low dose and are only for 5 days. I am used to 2 weeks of steriods when I reach this point otherwise it doesn’t get better. Starting at 60 for like 3 days. This time they gave me 30 for 2 days. ",

The total number burned down is approx 30%. \n\n \nThe priority for the 154 firefighters in Jasper is to put out any hot spots in the outskirts of Jasper and in the trees directly surrounding the town of Jasper and all structures. Cooler conditions are reducing fire behaviour as showers tapered off overnight. Winds are anticipated to reach up to 30 km/h and may increase fire activity.\n \nAssessments of infrastructure damages is ongoing. The damage within the townsite is estimated at around 30%. Out of a total of 1113 structures within the town, 358 have been destroyed. All critical infrastructure in Jasper was successfully protected including the hospital, emergency services building, both elementary and junior/senior schools, activity centre and wastewater treatment plant. We are grateful to our wildfire teams efforts to contain the fire and minimize the damage.\n \nThis wildfire is estimated to cover 36,000 hectares.\n \n\nUpdate for residents:\nResidents and businesses of the town of Jasper, we understand that this is an incredibly difficult and challenging time but our priorities remain addressing the active fire and assessing structural damage in the community. We are happy to report all critical infrastructure has been saved. We appreciate how hard it is to wait for confirmation about your homes.\n \nOur crews continue to fight the fire and we remain focused on making it safe for the people of Jasper to come home.
